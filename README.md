## About Tella <a id="about"></a>

In challenging environments, with limited or no internet connectivity or in the face of repression, Tella is an app that makes it easier and safer to document human rights violations and collect data. Tella is available Android and iOS. 

More information about how to get Tella --including user guides-- can be found on our [documentation platform](https://tella-app.org/docs).

Tella:
- encrypts photo, video, documents and audio files in a separate gallery so it cannot be accessed from the phone's regular gallery or file explorer.
- hides itself by changing its name and icon in the list of apps.
- captures metadata when taking photos, videos, and audio recordings to verify the origin of the files.
- allows users to quickly delete all files in Tella's encrypted Gallery.
- enables users working with a group or organization to collect and send data to a server without relying on third-party apps or servers.

## Why Tella? <a id="why-tella"></a>

Tella's goal is to protect at-risk individuals and groups--advocates, journalists, human rights defenders--from repressive surveillance, whether physical or digital. Tella aims to provide a highly usable solution, accessible to all with minimal or no training, to collect, safeguard, and communicate sensitive information in highly repressive environments.

Tella has three main objectives:

- Protecting users who engage in documentation from physical and digital repression
- Protecting the data they collect from censorship, tampering, interception, and destruction
- Empowering individuals and groups to easily, quickly, and effectively collect data and produce high quality documentation that can be used for research, advocacy, or transitional justice

Tella is used by:
- Activists, organizers and human rights defenders to safely document events in their communities, produce reliable and verifiable evidence, and store data encrypted on their mobile devices.
- Media, professional reporters and citizen journalists to store sensitive media files encrypted as they travel, particularly as they cross borders.
- Civil society professionals and humanitarian workers to conduct interviews and collect data in poorly connected environments or in conflict areas.
- Electoral observation and monitoring organizations to monitor elections from inside and outside polling stations in real time and expose electoral fraud.
- Research institutions and international organizations to conduct research, interviews or surveys in challenging environments, particularly in conflict areas.
